<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A total of two datasets will be used in this project, namely
<em>Seasons_Stats.csv</em> and <em>All.NBA.1984-2018.csv</em>. These two
datasets were all originally parsed from a website called <a
href="https://www.basketball-reference.com">Basketball Reference</a>.
Nevertheless, I chose to use the more ready-to-go datasets provided by
the users on Kaggle.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>Seasons_Stats.csv</em> file can be accessed through this
<a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=Seasons_Stats.csv">link</a>.
This dataset contains players’ game statistics from year 1950 to 2017.
To be more specific, there are a total of 53 columns, and each
column(except the first column, which is just a column of index starting
from 0 to 24690) represents an attribute of that player. These
attributes include basic statistics such as games played (G) and total
points scored in that season (PTS) as well as the more advanced metrics
such as Win Shares (WS), which is an estimate of the number of wins
contributed by that player.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>All.NBA.1984-2018.csv</em> file can be accessed through
this <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/kerneler/starter-all-nba-players-1984-2018-e8f3592a-1/data?select=All.NBA.1984-2018.csv">link</a>.
This dataset contains all the players that are selected to be in All-NBA
teams starting from the 1984-1985 season to the 2016-2017 season. One
thing to note is that before the 1988-1989 season, only 2 teams of
All-NBA teams were selected each year; and starting from the 1988-1989
season, a total of 3 teams of All-NBA teams were selected each year.
This dataset has a total of 32 columns, and each column represents an
attribute of that player. These attributes include basic statistics such
as the season which that player was selected in the All-NBA teams
(Season) as well as the more advanced metrics such as effective field
goal percentage (eFG%).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, I will not be using all the data from these two datasets
in that some important advanced data for the 1950s-1970s are missing
(because some of the advanced metrics were only introduced in the 80s).
Moreover, the league and the players in this league have evolved
throughout the years, so the data from earlier seasons can hardly be
doing a good job of predicting whether or not a current player gets
chosen to be on the All-NBA team. Consequently, I will only be looking
at the data from 2000 (the year I was born) to 2017 (the latest year
that these two datasets have) for this project.</p>
<p>Every year, there are more than 450 NBA players that play in a single
season, but only 15 of them would get selected into the All-NBA teams
for that season. This makes me wonder what makes these 15 players stand
out from all the NBA players. Consequently, the question that I am
trying to answer is: <strong>what characteristics of an NBA player are
more indicative of selection to the All-NBA teams, and to what extent
can I predict the selection of All-NBA team using the players’
statistics?</strong></p>
<p>After completing the data wrangling part, we can now see a total of
7220 rows of players’ stats from 2000-2017.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dim(players_pergame)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 7220   24</code></pre>
<p>In addition, there are 273 rows of All-NBA players (All_NBA = 1)
where in fact we should only have 270 players (18 seasons * 15
players/season = 270 players). This is because Dikembe Mutombo was
counted 2 extra times (he switched teams twice during the 2000-2001
season), and Chauncey Billups was counted a total of 1 extra time (he
switched teams once during the 2008-2009 season). Nevertheless, I decide
to keep these 3 extra entries because, though on different teams, their
stats could still represent their overall performances within that
season.</p>

<p>Let’s compare the distributions of some basic features (namely
points, rebounds, and assists) between All_NBA players and players that
were not selected in any All-NBA teams. The plots in the first row are
using all the players’ data, and the plots in the second row are using
only the players that were selected in the All-NBA Teams. The vertical
lines of each plot represent the average value of that corresponding
feature and population.</p>
<p><img src="introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p><strong>Descriptions and justifications of the
methodology:</strong></p>
<p>Given that my dataset <em>players_pergame</em>, after pre-processing
and data wrangling, has a binary outcome variable named All_NBA, I would
choose to implement a multivariate logistic regression for this dataset
first. Using a logistic regression model on a binary outcome dataset
seems to be a go-to strategy first and can be used to compare to other
more advanced and computationally heavy models later on. In addition,
all of my variables that concern players’ performances are continuous
variables, which also makes it more reasonable to try out a regression
model first. Furthermore, I am considering using a random forest model,
which is a powerful method that generally performs well. It also gives
us a lot of opportunities to tune our parameters for the model, such as
<em>mtry</em>, so as to ameliorate our model’s performance and
prediction results. Moreover, tree-based methods (and boosting)
generally performs better on imbalanced dataset than other
classification algorithms. Consequently, I decided to implement
multivariate logistic regression and random forests on my dataset.
Lastly, I would also like to give some justifications for not choosing
some of the algorithms that we mentioned in class. First of all, linear
regression was not chosen here since our outcome variable is binary.
Moreover, LDA and QDA were not selected here because, as you may tell
from the above 6 plots, some of the independent variables do not follow
Gaussian distributions, which violates the assumptions for LDA and QDA.
Lastly, decision tree was not selected in that random forest gives us
certain advantages over decision trees such as more stability and less
likely to overfit.</p>
